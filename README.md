MoodUp - a Mobile Mental Health Application

There is a rising concern about increasing rates of anxiety and depression among
children and young people. Mental health problems cause major distress and a
harmful impact on social relationships, school or even physical health. Digital surveillance of symptoms offers a promising and innovative way to de-
liver interventions for depression and psychotic disorders. Therefore, mobile health
(mHealth) offers an incredibly powerful platform for monitoring and management
of mental health symptoms.

This application's objective is to reduce the user's recurring symptoms of anxiety and depression by        providing data about their daily life events and grading each one depending on their mood.  After having graded some events, the user will be able to visualize, in charts, how their mood was influenced by different factors such as location, time, people's characteristics and so on.
